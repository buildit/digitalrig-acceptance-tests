== Target use cases

. Rig post upgrade acceptance tests execution
. Pipeline scripts TDD
. Pipeline library compatability testing against target server

== TODOs:

. create helper class to execute and assert arbitrary jobs
.. executePipeline(pipeline: Path): BuildDetails
.. Goes to base junit class >>> assertSuccessfulPipeline(pipeline: Path) void
.. Write real nexus test (create empty rpm, deploy rpm, cleanup)
. create and start jenkins job
. wait for completion
. success/fail the test

== Possible improvements

. in-process assertions?
. allow out of pipeline assertions?
. use annotation / junit rule to deploy jobs?
